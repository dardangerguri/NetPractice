# NetPractice

NetPractice is a networking project designed to enhance understanding of TCP/IP addressing and network configurations.

## About the project

In NetPractice, you will work with simulated networks provided through a training interface accessible via a web browser. The objective is to configure these networks to resolve issues and make them operational. The project aims to deepen your knowledge of TCP/IP addressing and network troubleshooting techniques.

<strong>IP address</strong> is like a unique identifier for devices on a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other by specifying where data needs to be sent and received. IP addresses are represented as a series of numbers separated by periods, such as "192.168.1.1".

<strong>Subnet mask</strong> is used along with an IP address to define the network portion and the host portion of the address. It helps devices determine which part of the IP address belongs to the local network and which part identifies specific devices on that network.

<strong>Switch</strong> is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It receives data packets from one device and forwards them to the appropriate destination device based on the MAC (Media Access Control) address of each device.

<strong>Router</strong> is a networking device that connects multiple networks together, such as connecting a local network to the internet. It receives data packets from one network and forwards them to another network based on the IP address of each packet.
